This project, **GNews Sentiment Analysis with PySpark and TextBlob**, is designed to fetch and analyze real-time financial news articles using the **GNews API**, perform **sentiment analysis** at scale with **PySpark**, and visualize the results for quick insight into market mood. It begins by retrieving the latest finance-related news headlines and descriptions through API calls, then processes the text using **TextBlob**, which assigns a sentiment polarity score to each article — identifying whether it conveys a **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** tone. By leveraging **PySpark**, the analysis efficiently scales to handle large datasets, applying **user-defined functions (UDFs)** to compute sentiment scores and labels across all articles in a distributed manner. The resulting enriched dataset is then converted to a **Pandas DataFrame**, sorted, and visualized through a **Matplotlib bar chart**, clearly showing the distribution of news sentiment within the dataset.

The pipeline is structured for modularity and clarity — from fetching articles (`fetch_gnews`) to scoring (`get_sentiment_score`) and labeling (`get_sentiment_label`), all leading to the central PySpark-powered function `analyze_sentiment()`. The analysis output provides both tabular and graphical insights, helping identify whether current financial news leans more optimistic or pessimistic. This setup not only demonstrates how to combine **real-time data ingestion**, **natural language processing**, and **big data analytics**, but also serves as a template for broader applications such as **market sentiment monitoring**, **brand reputation tracking**, or **topic-based media analysis**. By integrating cloud-friendly, open-source tools, it offers a scalable and practical approach to transforming live news data into actionable sentiment intelligence.
